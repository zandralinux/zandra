Zandra Linux
============

Compiling
---------

To compile the base packages, edit config.mk then do the following:

    export configmk=$(pwd)/config.mk # in base directory
    export PATH="$CROSSPATH:$PATH" # add cross compiler to $PATH
    export mkbuild=$(pwd)/mkbuild # in base directory
    cd ports && mk
    
Currently we are in the process of updating packages to their current
versions (before Zandra they were last updated in 2015). Note that
most packages on there, with the exception of a few, are outdated and
the URLs may not even work.

Installing
----------

You can install to a root using the following:

    export ROOT="desired root"
    mk install

A bootable image can be made using the "bootable" target. IT ASSUMES
/dev/loop0 IS FREE SO IF IT'S NOT, DON'T RUN THE SCRIPT!!
