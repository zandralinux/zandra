Zandra Linux
============

Compiling
---------

To compile the base packages, edit config.mk then do the following:

    export configmk=$(pwd)/config.mk # in base directory
    export PATH="$CROSSPATH:$PATH" # add cross compiler to $PATH
    export mkbuild=$(pwd)/mkbuild # in base directory
    cd ports && mk
    
Currently the base packages are in the process of being updated to
their current versions (before Zandra they were last updated in 2015).
Note that most packages on there, with the exception of a few, are
outdated and the URLs may not even work.

Installing
----------

We haven't gotten to that point yet.
