Generic stuff
-------------

 * Fix broken ports.
 * Build packages.
 * Make a toolchain build script.
 * Finish man pages for pkgtools.
 * Figure out what we need for the base system.
 * Make Zandra self-hosting.
 * Update pkgtools (package metadata) maybe.
 * Make sure mkbuild quits on bad hash.
 * Use mawk, gnu sed, gavin's bc, byacc, openbsd m4, sabotage netbsd-curses.
 * Look into using util-linux programs instead of e2fsprogs.
 * Figure out kernel modules or no by default.
 * Put website back up.
 * Find new diff, lex, patch.
 * pkgtools frontend script.
 * install script (install base software to specified root).
 * c89, c99 frontend scripts.
 * automatically add base installed packages to /var/pkg (probably should do
   image creation based on pkgtools rather than just mkbuild).
